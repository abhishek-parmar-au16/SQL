#Key Differnce


A primary key constrain is a column that uniquely identifies every row in the table of the relational database management system, while foreign key is a column that creates a relationship between two tables.

Primary Key never accepts null values whereas foreign key may accept multiple null values.

You can have only a single primary key in a table while you can have multiple foreign keys in a table.

The value of the primary key can't be removed from the parent table whereas the value of foreign key value can be removed from the child table.

No two rows can have any identical values for a primary key on the other hand a foreign key can contain duplicate values.

There is no limitation in inserting the values into the table column while inserting any value in the foreign key table, ensure that the value is present into a column of a primary key.
