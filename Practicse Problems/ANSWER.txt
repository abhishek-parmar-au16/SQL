FROM actor
WHERE last_name LIKE '%LI%'
ORDER BY last_name, first_name;

SELECT last_name, COUNT(*) AS `Count`
FROM actor
GROUP BY last_name;

3. The actor ‘HARPO WILLIAMS’was accidentally entered in the actor table as
’GROUCHO WILLIAMS’. Write a query to fix the record.

UPDATE actor 
SET first_name= 'HARPO'

SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, a.address
FROM staff s LEFT JOIN address a ON s.address_id = a.address_id;

5. Use JOIN to display the total amount rung up by each staff member in August
of 2005. Use tables staff and payment.

SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, SUM(p.amount) AS 'TOTAL'
FROM staff s LEFT JOIN payment p  ON s.staff_id = p.staff_id
GROUP BY s.first_name, s.last_name;

6. How many copies of the film Hunchback Impossible exist in the inventory

FROM customer c LEFT JOIN payment p ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
GROUP BY c.first_name, c.last_name
ORDER BY c.last_name


7. Using the tables payment and customer and the JOIN command, list the total

SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, SUM(p.amount) AS 'TOTAL'
FROM customer c LEFT JOIN payment p ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
GROUP BY c.first_name, c.last_name
ORDER BY c.last_name
